	- Loading recipe JSON files and processing them into IRecipe classes
	- Downloading recipe data from a remote host if not already found in cache (hardcoded filename at the moment)
	- Able to display particular recipes as Nodes
	- Nodes are able to be overclocked (only applies if node contains a GregtechRecipe; however, no GUI exists yet to utilize this feature)
	- Overclocked nodes have a label that displays the overclock information
	- The inputs and outputs of a node can be hovered over with the mouse, displaying a transparent highlight
		- Code is ready for additonal functionality (clicking on the particular inputs/outputs)
	- Nodes are compatible with non-Gregtech recipes as well; only applicable data will be displayed on the node
	- Nodes are able to be dragged, in order to change their position on the screen
	- Nodes are able to be removed from the screen
	- Using the Search GUI works, and new nodes are able to be added using it
	- Search GUI Filters include: Item/Fluid name, whether the item/fluid is in the Input, Output, or both, and name of the process type (machine name, etc)
	- Saving and automatic loading of nodes from a file
